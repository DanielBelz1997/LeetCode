for grouping all kinds of diifrent row toghether or dividing them:

SELECT
    idshav,
    taf,
    mes,
    id_mi,
    CONCAT(taf, '_', COALESCE(mes, 'NULL'), '_',
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY taf, COALESCE(mes, 'NULL')),
           '_', ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY taf, COALESCE(mes, 'NULL'), id_mi ORDER BY idshav)
    ) AS group_identifier
FROM
	shav;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

for before inserting some rows with date, tell the inserter that this person is withing some places:

SELECT *
FROM SampleTable
WHERE person = @newPerson
    AND (

        OR
        (@newEndDate BETWEEN start_date AND end_date)    -- New end date falls within existing date range
        OR
        (start_date BETWEEN @newStartDate AND @newEndDate)  -- Existing start date falls within new date range
